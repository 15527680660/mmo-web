//If this code is not in a define call,
//DO NOT use require('foo'), but use the async
//callback version:
require(['foo'], function (foo) {
    //foo is now loaded.
});

If you are using the simplified define wrapper, make sure you have require as the first argument to the definition function:

define(function (require) {
    var namedModule = require('name');
});

If you are listing dependencies in the dependency array, make sure that require and name are in the dependency array:

define(['require', 'name'], function (require) {
    var namedModule = require('name');
});
